    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the dataset from Problem 1, split the data into training, validation and testing as follows:\n",
    "* Training: All data from the years 2014-2016\n",
    "* Validation: All data from 2017\n",
    "* Training: All data from 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a regression model to predict one of the cycleway data series in your dataset. In developing this model you should:\n",
    "* Initially, use all weather data (temperature, rainfall and solar exposure) and all other data series for a particular counter type (i.e. if you’re predicting cyclists inbound for a counter, use all other cyclist inbound counters)\n",
    "* Use p-values, qqplots, and performance on the validation set to remove terms and improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have finished refining the model, evaluate it on test set, and compare the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the training, validation and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In training the model, you will need to ensure that you have no samples (i.e. rows) with missing data. As such, you should remove samples with missing data from the dataset before training and evaluating the model. This may also mean that you have to remove some columns that contain large amounts of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The first linear regression example, ``CAB420_Regression_Example_1_Linear_Regression.ipynb`` is a useful starting point here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The following packages are suggested, however there are many ways to approach things in python, if you'd rather use different pacakges that's cool too."
