    "## Combining and Filtering Multiple Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "CAB420 Tutorial1.zip contains a number of datasets, split into two directories as follows:\n",
    "* BOM, which contains Bureau of Meteorology data for Brisbane City from the years 1999-2019. The data is split into three files.\n",
    " * IDCJAC0009_040913_1800_Data.csv contains daily rainfall data;\n",
    " * IDCJAC0010_040913_1800_Data.csv contains maximum daily temperature data; and\n",
    " * IDCJAC0013_040913_1800_Data.csv contains daily solar exposure data.\n",
    "* BCCCyclewayCounts contains five years data (from 2014-2018) for Brisbane City Council cycleways, with data for each year being in a separate file (i.e. bike-ped-auto-counts-2014.csv contains data for the year 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to combine these datasets into a single table using Python (or the programming language of your choice such that):\n",
    "* You have a single table that spans the time period of the BCCCyclewayCounts data;\n",
    "* Duplicate information is avoided (i.e. you don’t have multiple date columns, or similar);\n",
    "* For the cycle way data, only columns that are available in all years data are included in the final table (i.e. if a counter is available in 2014 − 2017, but not 2018, that column should be excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The following packages are suggested, however there are many ways to approach things in python, if you'd rather use different pacakges that's cool too."

If you wish to do this, you can convert the three date values in each row (Year, Month, Day) to a datetime object with the following function. You could use the ``apply()`` function that operates over a pandas dataframe to apply this to your tables.\n",

    "Ideally, it'd be good to merge these into one overall weather table. It's suggested to do a quick visualisation of your BOM data after it's loaded. The ``head()`` function is good for this. You may then want to remove some redundant columns. ``drop()`` can be used to achieve this."
