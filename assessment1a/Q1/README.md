- Current set up to run the python scripts,

#### Load the data:
Unzip CAB420 Assessment 1A Data.zip
Access the Q1 directory to find the socio-economic data for various US communities
Load the training, validation, and testing data sets as separate data frames using a library such as Pandas.

#### Data cleaning and preparation:
Examine the data to identify missing or corrupted values.
Remove or impute any missing data.
Normalize the data to ensure that the variables are on a similar scale.

#### Train a linear regression model:
Use a library such as scikit-learn to train a linear regression model on the training data.
Use the model to make predictions on the validation data.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.

#### Train a Ridge regression model:
Use scikit-learn to train a Ridge regression model on the training data.
Use the validation data to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.

#### Train a LASSO regression model:
Use scikit-learn to train a LASSO regression model on the training data.
Use the validation data to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.

#### Compare and analyze the results:
Compare the performance of the three models on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
Evaluate the complexity and interpretability of each model.
Analyze the relationship between the socio-economic variables and the number of violent crimes per capita.
Provide recommendations or insights based on the results.
That's it! These steps should help you complete the tasks and evaluate the link between socio-economic factors and crime.
