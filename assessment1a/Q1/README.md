Steps taken to complete this question

#### Load the data:
- Unzip CAB420 Assessment 1A Data.zip
- Access the Q1 directory to find the socio-economic data for various US communities
- Load the training, validation, and testing data sets as separate data frames using a library such as Pandas.

#### Explore the data:

- Check the dimensions and data types of the data.
- Look for missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
- Plot histograms, scatterplots, and other visualizations to get an idea of the relationships between the variables.

#### Prepare the data 
- Separate the target variable (ViolentCrimesPerPop) from the features.
- Standardize the feature data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can help the models converge faster.

#### Data cleaning and preparation:
- Examine the data to identify missing or corrupted values.
- Remove or impute any missing data.
- Normalize the data to ensure that the variables are on a similar scale.

#### Train a linear regression model:
- Use a library such as scikit-learn to train a linear regression model on the training data.
- Use the model to make predictions on the validation data.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
- Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
- Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.

- Import the linear regression model from a machine learning library like scikit-learn.
- Fit the model to the training data.
- Predict the target variable using the model and the testing data.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

#### Train a Ridge regression model:
- Use scikit-learn to train a Ridge regression model on the training data.
- Use the validation data to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
- Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
- Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.

- Import the Ridge regression model from a machine learning library like scikit-learn.
- Use a grid search with cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ using the validation data.
- Fit the model to the training data using the optimal value of λ.
- Predict the target variable using the model and the testing data.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

#### Train a LASSO regression model:
- Use scikit-learn to train a LASSO regression model on the training data.
- Use the validation data to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
- Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
- Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.

- Import the LASSO regression model from a machine learning library like scikit-learn.
- Use a grid search with cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ using the validation data.
- Fit the model to the training data using the optimal value of λ.
- Predict the target variable using the model and the testing data.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

#### Compare and analyze the results:
- Compare the performance of the three models on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
- Evaluate the complexity and interpretability of each model.
- Analyze the relationship between the socio-economic variables and the number of violent crimes per capita.
- Provide recommendations or insights based on the results.
- That's it! These steps should help you complete the tasks and evaluate the link between socio-economic factors and crime.

- Compare the performance of the three models using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared on the testing data.
- Consider the model complexity and the interpretability of the coefficients when comparing the models.
- Draw conclusions about the relationships between the socio-economic factors and violent crime based on the coefficients of the best-performing model.
