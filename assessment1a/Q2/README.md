Load the data:
Access the Q2 directory to find the training, validation, and testing data files.
Load the data sets as separate data frames using a library such as Pandas.
Data cleaning and preparation:
Examine the data to identify missing or corrupted values.
Remove or impute any missing data.
Ensure that the data is correctly formatted and consistent across all data sets.
Train a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Classifier:
Use a library such as scikit-learn to train a KNN classifier on the training data.
Use a grid search to identify the optimal value of K, as well as any other hyperparameters such as distance metric.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the validation set.
Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.
Train a Random Forest Classifier:
Use scikit-learn to train a Random Forest classifier on the training data.
Use a grid search to identify the optimal hyperparameters, such as the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, and splitting criterion.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the validation set.
Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.
Train an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Use scikit-learn to train an ensemble of SVMs on the training data.
Use a grid search to identify the optimal hyperparameters, such as the kernel type, regularization parameter C, and gamma.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the validation set.
Refine the model as necessary based on the validation results.
Use the final model to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate its performance.
Compare and analyze the results:
Compare the performance of the three models on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model, such as computational efficiency, model complexity, and interpretability.
Provide recommendations or insights based on the results.
That's it! These steps should help you train and evaluate the performance of three multi-class classifiers to classify land type from the spectral data.
